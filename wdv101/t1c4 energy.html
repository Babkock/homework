	<p>If you actually fall for this "global warming" nonsense, you are a sucker!!! Not real!!! Global warming is a joke made up by Al Gore in 2000 to
	help boost his internet investments!! Rush Limbaugh said so!!!!! I drive a hummer and pollute lakes and rivers for fun!!!! Hahaha!!! My information
	is 100% accurate because Fox News said so.</p>

	<p style="font-size:11px;">I am not actually a climate change denier. I understand the phenomenon of global warming. This homework assignment
	was written in a satirical tone for fun. I do not like Donald Trump.</p>
