				<h3>The Intergalactic Travel Agency</h3>
				<br />
				<p>Our vacation program offers complete life insurance for you and your loved ones! We've only had 7 deaths this year. Don't worry about that cosmic debris or asteroids, our space travel program has been certified by NASA and also NAFTA.</p>
				<p>Fox News said we're a bunch of mad scientists. But PBS knows what's up! We've had (almost) awesome press coverage for our galaxy-renowned travel program. Travel all throughout the galaxy, and even to a few locations in the neighboring Andromeda! Don't even trip about those light years, your skin is already beautiful and age-resistant, and we have warp-speed technology.</p>
				<p>The Triangle Travel Planners (not to be confused with the Bermuda Triangle, for which we have known agreements with) uses the acclaimed technology of the Starship Waffle Fries to transport you and your loved ones to parts unknown! But known to us. Don't worry about it. Your molecules are okay. Just remember to shower in tomato juice once a week.</p>

					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZAh3b2vNf8"><img src="images/planets.jpg" title="Damn look at all these planets" /></a>
					<h2>Mars</h2>
					<p>Wow what a nice vacation spot. Beautiful red rocks, gray skies, and frozen lakes with probably actual water! The sun looks blue sometimes. There's like 6 moons, I think. The atmosphere is pretty dense but you can
					handle it if you bring an inhaler. The locals are very friendly and courteous. Wowee! I sure would love to vacation at Mars. It's in my top 5 favorite planets of all time,
					and I can recall many life adventures I've had there! Be sure to try to the local specialty, the fried bone marrow on a stick! Yum!!!</p>
				</section>
				<section id="two">
					<h2>Venus</h2>
					<p>Damn look at that Venus. Now that's a planet! The only thing missing from this planet is a casino and a racetrack! This planet is gonna knock your socks off! The ground is yellow I think. The atmosphere is really
					thick, the greenhouse effect over there is pretty crazy, but we have plenty of easy-to-use respirators! The lakes are hot and bubbly, and I think they're made of methane or something. There are also big
					meatballs in the sky, tourists often mistake them for moons. Be sure to try to the down-home-style wings with teriyaki sauce!!! Wow what a planet.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="three">
					<h2>Sagittarius A</h2>
					<p>Look at this crazy motherfucker. This is one supermassive black hole, sitting smack dab in the middle of the Milky Way galaxy. Our vacation program offers a safe, reliable method of
					interdimensional transportation, so you can travel to and from the black hole safely. Event horizon got you down? Not anymore! Check out the entire future history of the universe from
					inside this guy. Bring your bathing suits, because there's a galaxy-renowned water park with lots of slides! It gets pretty weird sometimes. You ever see 2001: A Space Odyssey? It's like that.</p>
