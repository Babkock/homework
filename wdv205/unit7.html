				<p>In this half of the page, we're going to look at the Translate and Rotate effects. This is the left half.</p>

				<h3 class="code">translate()</h3>
				<div class="trans-box">
					<p>This box has the <span class="code">translate()</span> effect. It starts in one spot, but, if you hover over it,
					it will move to a completely different spot. Wow!</p>
				</div>
				<p>Something to take note of: These transformations have a kind of "flickering" effect, if you idle the mouse pointer in an inconvenient spot. I am unsure how to remedy this.</p>
				<hr width="90%" color="blue" />
				<h3 class="code">rotate()</h3>
				<div class="rotate-box">
					<p>This box has the <span class="code">rotate()</span> effect. At the beginning, it's right-side up. Hover over here, and watch
					it <b>turn <i>upside down!</i></b>.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Wow, look at all of these cool CSS transformations. Pretty nifty, huh? Notice they all have :hover triggers and transitions. There's some more text here, there has to be text here so the page looks more complete. Even more text. Oh wow gee.</p>
				<center><p>&rarr; &rarr; &rarr; &rarr; &rarr;</p></center>

			<div class="body-right">
				<p>In this half of the page, we're going to look at the Scale and SkewX effects. This is the right half of the page. The box to the left
				should be a reddish color. This box is a light blue. There's a whole bunch of text in here, most of it doesn't really say anything.</p>
				<p><a href="unit7_style.css">View Compiled CSS</a></p>
				<h3 class="code">scale()</h3>
				<div class="scale-box">
					<p>This box has the <span class="code">scale()</span> effect. It starts at one size, but on a hover, it will grow to a much bigger size.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Something to take note of: These transformations have a kind of "flickering" effect, if you idle the mouse pointer in an inconvenient spot. I am unsure how to remedy this.</p>
				<hr width="90%" color="red" />
				<h3 class="code">skewX()</h3>
				<div class="skewx-box">
					<p>Now... <b><i>THIS BOX</i></b> is.... askew! This box has the <span class="code">skewX()</span> effect. Hover over here and watch this
					box transform!</p>
				</div>
				<p>Here's the bottom of the right box. Look at all of this text. This text says nothing. Walls walls walls. Tear town these walls of text! This is a regular Berlin Wall of text, isn't it? <b>FREE PALESTINE 2018</b></p>
