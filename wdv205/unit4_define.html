		<li><h3>What does a CSS Preprocessor do?</h3>
		<p>A CSS preprocessor is a program, separate from any web client or server software, usually hosted on the programmer's machine, that optimizes and compiles
		psuedo-CSS code from a source file. Much like a C compiler can compile a C source file into bytecode, a CSS preprocessor can compile a markup language like SASS or LESS into
		CSS that the browser can intrepret. Note that the source code file, and the compiled product, are both in plain text.</p>
		</li>
		<li><h3>What are the advantages of using a CSS preprocessor?</h3>
		<p>Using a CSS preprocessor allows the programmer or designer to use a number of tools and optimizations, that would be otherwise unavailable in standard CSS. These optimizations include: variables, mixin functions,
		font stacks, and nested property lists. So, for example, using SASS, instead of writing this hard-coded CSS...</p>
		<pre>
		div {
			background-color:cyan;
			color:black;
			padding:20px;
			font-size:1.1em;
		}
		div ul, div table {
			width:100%;
			background-color:green;
			color:black;
			font-size:1em;
		}
		</pre>
		You could write this simpler, marked up SASS.
		<pre>
		$BgColor1 = cyan;
		$BgColor2 = green;
		$Text = black;
		
		div {
			background-color:$BgColor1;
			color:$Text;
			padding:20px;
			font-size:1.1em;
			ul, table {
				width:100%;
				background-color:$BgColor2;
				color:$Text;
				font-size:1em;
			}
		}
		</pre></li>
		<li><h3>What are the disadvantages or issues you need to consider when using a CSS preprocessor?</h3>
		<p>One important difference, between using standard CSS and a preprocessor, is that raw CSS doesn't need to be compiled. You can copy the style source file to your server,
		immediately after saving it, and the changes will take place immediately. Preprocessor CSS requires another step. The file, ending in <span class="code">.scss</span> or <span class="code">.sass</span>, is not directly interpreted by the browser,
		and is considered useless or unreadable, until it is compiled.</p>
		<p>Optimizing to use a Preprocessor also has the potential for breaking certain elements, or ignoring important rules, depending on the programmer's specifications or
		oversights.</p></li>
		
		<li><h3>List at least five CSS preprocessors.</h3>
		<p>SASS, LESS, Stylus, CSS-Crush, Myth.</p></li>
