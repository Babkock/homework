			<h2>Hey! It's a heading! Here's my flex-box stuff!</h2>
			<p>Here is a flex-row of buttons. These are oriented with the "flex-direction" of "row".</p>
			<p style="font-size:0.95em !important;">Hey, here is some more paragraph text for my assignment. This text says nothing. I need to fill up more space on the page, so I am typing this. Hello world.</p>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<button class="btn">One</button>
				<button class="btn">Two</button>
				<button class="btn">Three</button>
				<button class="btn">Four</button>
			</div>
			<p>Here is a flex-column of buttons. These are oriented with the "flex-direction" or "column".</p>
			<div class="flex-column">
				<button class="col-btn">One</button>
				<button class="col-btn">Two</button>
				<button class="col-btn">Three</button>
				<button class="col-btn">Four</button>
			</div>
			<p style="font-size:0.95em !important;">I hope these buttons look nice. This stuff is difficult to style sometimes. Hey I am now typing some more text, some more nothingness to fill up space. Look at all of these words.</p>

			<h2>Image Gallery Time!!!</h2>
			<p>Here is an image gallery, using images from my <b>Intro to Photoshop and Fireworks</b> class.</p>
			<p style="font-size:0.94em !important;">This is some smaller paragraph text, for filling up space in the box. It is a little bit smaller than the main paragraph text, so that the other paragraphs are more attention-grabbing.</p>

			<p>Here is some more text, to fill up the box. This text serves no purpose except to take up space on the web page. It looks like I put more effort into this than I actually did. Hooray!</p>
