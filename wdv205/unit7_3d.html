				<h2>CSS <b>3D</b> Transformations!</h2>

				<p>In this half of the page, we're going to look at the 3D versions of translate, rotate, and scale effects. Please look at this SASS markup, it's beautiful, it's gorgeous!</p>
				<p><a href="unit7_3d_style.scss">View SASS Markup</a></p>
				<h3 class="code">translate3d()</h3>
				<div class="trans-box">
					<p>This box has the <span class="code">translate3d()</span> effect. It starts in one spot, but, if you hover over it,
					it will move to a completely different spot. Wow!</p>
				</div>
				<p>Here's some more text, to take up space on the page. Look at all of this text. It says nothing. These are pretty weird transformations, huh?</p>
				<hr width="90%" color="blue" />
				<h3 class="code">rotate3d()</h3>
				<div class="rotate-box">
					<p>This box has the <span class="code">rotate3d()</span> effect. Watch it flip around the page! This rotate transformation has a "hover" trigger.</p>
				</div>
				<p>And then there's some more text down here. Woooah goodbye down text. I wish this page looked better. I don't know how to make it look better, but I wish it looked better.</p>
				<center><p>&rarr; &rarr; &rarr; &rarr; &rarr;</p></center>
			</div>
			<div class="body-right">
				<p>Whatever you do, <b><i>DON'T</i></b> look at this CSS! It's messy, and gross, and makes no sense. It's a big blog of gibberish that doesn't even look nice. CSS? No such thing.</p>

				<h3 class="code">scale3d()</h3>
				<div class="scale-box">
					<p>This box has the <span class="code">scale3d()</span> effect. Woah turn around woah</p>
				</div>
				<p>Wow, look at all of these words. These words say something, and these words don't. Saying things on a web page looks like this. Make sure you <b>Save the Jews!</b> this weekend!</p>
				<hr width="90%" color="red" />
				<h3 class="code">skewX()</h3>
				<div class="skewz-box">
					<p><span class="code">skewX()</span> V&#216;ID.V&#216;ID.V&#216;ID.V&#216;ID.STR&Eacute;&Eacute;&Eacute;&Eacute;EEETCH</p>
				</div>
				<p>And then there's some more text down here. Bottom text, text on the bottom. Gee. These words say nothing, and neither do these. No words no thoughts no sentences. Post-rock music 2010. Free Palestine.</p>
				<center><p>&larr; &larr; &larr; &larr; &larr;</p></center>

				<p>This is the footer of the page. I hope you enjoyed these CSS 3D transformations.</p>
