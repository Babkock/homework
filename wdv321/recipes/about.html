				<p>Awesome Recipes is a Javascript and <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>-based recipe editor. It uses local storage to preserve recipe objects. It was styled with <a href="https://sass-lang.org" target="_blank">SASS</a> and its assets were compiled with <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/webpack" target="_blank">Webpack</a>.</p>
				<p>The <a href="edit.html">Recipe Editor</a> works by receiving a filename. If a filename is not specified in the editor from the <a href="view.html">View Page</a>, it prompts the user for one. It then loads a saved recipe object into its interface for editing. The user, while filling out the recipe form, has the option of overwriting the existing recipe file, or creating a new one, by modifying the <b>filename</b> field.</p>
				<p>This project was made for <b>WDV321 Advanced Javascript</b> by Tanner Babcock. It was designed and developed in October and November 2020. You can browse the <a href="https://github.com/Babkock/homework/tree/master/wdv321/recipes" target="_blank">source code here</a>. The web app implements responsive design by incorporating both portrait and landscape screen-based styles.</p>
