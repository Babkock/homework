# Awesome Recipes

This is my [Recipes project](https://tannerbabcock.com/homework/wdv321/recipes/home.html) for **WDV321 Advanced Javascript**. As you can see by the **package.json**, it depends on quite a bit
of [NPM](https://npmjs.org) packages. It is based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), and it is capable of saving and loading recipe objects from local storage.

There are four pages:

* The display page (Home)
* The file selector page (View Recipes)
* The file editor (Editor)
* The about page (About)

Pre-compiled assets are included. Run `npm run build` to compile the assets with Webpack.
